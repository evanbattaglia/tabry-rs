TODO before "public announcement"
* put on cargo; nix; instructions for installing. Maybe brew & deb too.
* test on zsh, fish
--- very soon after
* combining the three includes (sub, arg, flag) in the JSON format would be great
* flags like -abc -> -a, -b, -c
* go through TODOs
-- soon after
* tests to 80% coverage (goal 100% eventually)
* set up github automated tests
* I think I need to use bytes instead of strings for reading argv
