TODO before "public announcement"
* go through TODOs and do important ones
* is bash delegate working? (I thought it didn't with git, need to make sure I actually have tgit completion there)
* delegate fish support would be really nice
---
* put on cargo
* more examples / language reference in this repo.
   delegate "super aliases"
* bump version number and add deb
* better instructions for installing (build from source, cargo, nix, deb)

-- very soon after
* flags like -abc -> -a, -b, -c

-- soon after
* tests to 80% coverage (goal 100% eventually)
* more TODOs from code
* reqd flags
* delegate varargs -- delegate rest of args
* documentation about using the tabry gem + "completion json" for speedy tab complteion, and in tabry
* set up github automated tests
* I think I need to use bytes instead of strings for reading argv

-- much later
* actually use argument names, titles, and descriptions -- probably a'help' thing? although I'm not sure of the use without a CLI library
* CLI library? compile to clap (requires types)? not sure of the future
* using COMP_TYPE (normal completion, successive, partial word, etc.) could be useful
