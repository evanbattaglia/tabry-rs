TODO before "public announcement"
* fish and nix support merged
* zsh support/testing
* go through TODOs
* get remaning example tests from ruby working
* combining the three includes (sub, arg, flag) in the JSON format would be great
---
* put on cargo
* bump version number and add deb
* better instructions for installing (build from source, cargo, nix, deb)

-- very soon after
* flags like -abc -> -a, -b, -c
-- soon after
* tests to 80% coverage (goal 100% eventually)
* set up github automated tests
* I think I need to use bytes instead of strings for reading argv
